## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
  I learned more about Visual Studio Code and also using git to initialize a repository through the command line. I also liked the practice using Flexbox and trying to vertically center the qr code card

### Continued development

I would like to continue Flexbox so I can become confident in using it, and understanding when I might want to use it over CSS grids.
